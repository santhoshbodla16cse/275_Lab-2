# 275_Lab-2

## Introduction
Goal : The purpose of this Lab is to understand Multi-Language Coupling. In this report, we worked on addressing the following questions:
### What technologies exist for language coupling?
### What modern language couplings exist?
### How is it done?

## Multi-Language Coupling
Language coupling is basically an interface that provides the ability of a programming language to use a foreign library or operating system service (one that is not native to that language).
Multi-Language coupling uses multiple languages(like C with Python) to achieve high performance and efficient memory management.

We have chosen to implement Cython as an example to illustrate language coupling.

Cython is an optimizing static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.
